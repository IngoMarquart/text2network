Start a cross-school media team. At my previous institution, the media team produced online educational content, videos for marketing, and livestreamed events. The departments at ESMT are very siloed though there is obvious overlap in resource sharing, knowledge sharing, and reuse of content.
Start programs completely online, have a team only for that. Stop printing documents for programs. Be more transparent for employees and recognize their work (also with more money). Good people make good programs and if you want to keep them you have to pay them acceptably. Colleagues alone are not enough to stay with one company.
Always begin by asking what we need for our core business to thrive. Everything else should revolve around this. Provide qualified support to faculty for writing cases, opinion pieces, developing new teaching material, developing new digital products that convert their ideas into something we can sell (e.g., tailored self-development plans on a topic we developed that we can offer to participants). Collect and use data for everything important we do (e.g., marketing), then analyze and make informed decisions. Continue to invest in blended learning, although the EdTech, as it currently stands is absolutely NOT what we need (it feels as though faculty and PDs are the clients of the ExecEd, not the other way around). Continue to break the silos between ExecEd and Degree. Continue to be a healthy, pleasant community. Stop looking backwards and telling no. There are some heavy weight colleagues who actively discourage creativity by believing and telling out loud that "we have always done it this way; or, we have tried that already and it didn't work" Ban that attitude and let the creative ones guide us into the future. In particular, we have a bunch of very talented and creative new hires (I'm thinking about PDs but not only) who have brought about enormous positive change and can help us do much more.
Size of faculty remains below critical in many areas. This creates challenges with teaching overloads but it also makes it difficult to attract junior faculty, and we are not perceived as a "full" player in the academic community. So, despite the financial challenges, we need to continue growing the faculty. In addition, we might think about creative ways to expand the intellectual community. Concrete idea: A postdoc "program" (which means space and some salary support). Compared to most other institutions the management of "internal" decisions is quite different and a bit diffuse. In other schools, there is a senior associate dean who ties together all internal aspects, including primary responsibility for faculty. I have not thought through the pros and cons, but my sense is that we need such a person and/or that the faculty dean needs to move up in the hierarchy (not just as member of the EMC, but as #2).
I have a subjective feeling that in recent couple of years the school has been doing a lot in terms of creating a comfortable working environment for all of us. There have been lots of initiatives on improving the quality of our working life, reduction in the burden/load of work, paying attention to primadonnas and their specific needs and interests, and overall making ESMT an employer of choice. I think we have largely succeeded in it. What we may have somewhat lost is the speed of reaction, willingness to go an extra mile, and flexibility. For example, we could be teaching more on the weekends (in degree and in exec ed), we could start sessions earlier and finish later, having multiple schedules for different students and increasing the use of the facilities and faculty, combining courses with students of different programs (in degree, particularly). We used to do a lot with fewer (human) resources, and I think we are losing that ability. We need to reduce the use of external faculty/instructors in our programs. 
Trainings on how to work and report digitally. Less paper, less ink, less folders, less storage, less trash. See answer before on Total Loyalty Marketing including staff. Make ESMT a creative and accepting space where employees are not only allowed, but encouraged to make mistakes. An employee's abilities and talents are recognized, promoted and developed. Cannot stress this enough: COLLECT IDEAS! Accept ideas when brought forward at a time when you didn't actively ask for them. Employees are usually the biggest expense? For a good reason, because they are the greatest asset with way more potential than is currently being used.
Its time that ESMT is not driven by its building. The building is nice, but its more important what is inside. Faculty needs to be enlarged, include teaching staff from exed, more faculty members close to business. More collaboration between departments are needed. Leadership style needs to change. Top-down, manipulative, political, greedy needs to leave. We need exemplary leaders. As an organization we need more transparency, more internal collaboration, better communication better listening. Faculty needs to come out of their ivory tower and act as colleagues to the "peasants" and act as co-leaders within this organization. The whole ESMT image needs to change, remove all the old-styled, stiff, conservative bits and emphasize the new, modern, hip, cool, constantly improving, changing, collaborative business school that stands for the future. Blue ocean strategy. The business school for the future. Or even move away from the category "business school". What are we? "A knowledge and learning center or competence / network." We should be something cooler than a business school. We need to understand what is the network of organizations (companies, universities, public institutions, nations) that we are / need to be embedded in to achieve the change we are set out to achieve. Focus outside not only inside (stop the tendency for focusing only inside, on ourselves and be more generous, interested in the world).  
ESMT faculty should have more say on important strategic decisions for the school. This needs to start giving the faculty dean decision maker power at the same level as the president and CFO. ESMT governance rules need to be adjusted to incorporate this change in decision making. There is a shared worry among faculty that decisions or strategies about the future of ESMT will only consider ESMT faculty as a cost item, without any value. We do not want to be a consulting company, at least this was not the promise and the idea of teaching based Business School is rejected by the management team (as far as I am informed). We need to fulfill the requirements of being a high quality research based Business School by giving more power to the ESMT faculty and its dean at key decisions for the current and future strategy of ESMT. 
It's all about mind-set. We can have the newest technology, but the essential step before that is to have all colleagues on board, to educate everyone that it's doomed to be changes and please embrace them. Otherwise, all the efforts will be only superficial. This is a big challenge.
Observe internal cooperation and improve it. Make better use of networks and potential synergies between departments. Change the budgeting of IT to provide high quality virtual seminars for degree and exed and be more efficient internally. Do we need new or different IT competencies in house? Different software to implement cleaner and more efficient interfaces, for example Admin, Accounting. We surely can observe other processes and think whether these can be made more efficient and whether manpower can be used differently. Hire more managerial faculty that can teach topics relevant to exed and degree. Our faculty is great but needs to be more flexible. Research is important, but we need more teaching capacity and capability to serve the demand of exed and degree. Faculty should be more flexible when it comes to traveling. More funding to develop teaching excellence. Support PDs to develop into managerial faculty or coaches. Rethink incentive systems to support creativity and passion of employees. Do we need different roles than before? Will we need more program managers in the classical sense if we do more online / blended learning? What role can PDs play? We as exed should discuss whether we need practice groups and how we position ourselves. Maybe by customer segment? Work harder for brand recognition through content and supplying Marcom with personnel and budget, split into degree and exed. Rethink brands and create new brands (for school or only for exed). Keep exed part of gGMBH or profit gmbh like in the past? Rethink BTM center structure and rethink other institutes and centers. Pay more attention to alumni who can be important resources for degree, fundraising and exed. Implement a COO or provost as someone working internally. We have over 200 employees. The president should spent his time facing outward. The CFO can become more prominent or work more internally. I respect him, but perhaps a new person for this role should be appointed. More courageous decisions. Sometimes consciously stop doing things. Stop what is not working. Don't carry along things that do not work for long. Try new things and do them. Consider whether exed and degree can be led by a single person to make use of synergies. Rethink the China office. Pay attention to campus allocation and create new rooms faster. We should again rethink what we stand for as a school in the individual areas.
Top-management should not administer ESMT but provide AUTHENTICALLY inspiration, motivation and spirit to employees. Having a strategy which is not a wish list ("we want to be great in all categories") but which shows direction and priorities with regard to internal point of conflicts. I appreciate this project! Being more customer oriented/less administration oriented (Mr. Leuschner presents himself as a power person at ESMT not as a person which should deliver internal services to colleagues). Research which is more relevant for managers than for academic peers. Acquire much more money from third parties than in the past years.
Becoming a sustainability role model. Analyzing / auditing all areas of the organization (heat and energy, material resources, waste, food, suppliers) in terms of sustainability and define goals and measures how to improve.Sustainability Officer. Sustainability Roundtable (similar to the ILRT) with stakeholders from all ESMT. With any new building (or any new investment in general), go for the most sustainable option. i.e. build a zero-emission/energy positive student dormitory and new office building and according to the principles of circularity). Hiring staff and fostering research in the field of sustainability. Open program on sustainability/circular economy approach/sustainable innovation/ etc.  Stop Buying non-ecologic energy supplies.  More Sustainable economic thinking (circularity, interconnected systems). More Integration of sustainability and related topics across disciplines. More Digital meetings (I think we are all learning that this is well possible right now). More Train travel (make it the standard, and flight rather the exception). More	Open lectures on sustainability related topics. Less Traditional economic thinking (profit maximization, linearity). Less or no meat in the restaurant.
More home office. It has been shown that home office is practically feasible and can be as effective as working in an office. Furthermore, home office is a modern way of working and increases additionally employee motivation. 
Structured employee representation/ workers' council: It turned out to be weakness that the organization does not possess of a workers' council. The CEO/CFO were facing significant challenges in negotiating and communicating Kurzarbeit / salary cut measures as a consequence. Agreements had to be negotiated - in principle - individually with all employees separately which led to cumbersome communication and slowed down the process unnecessarily. In moving forward, the constitution of a workers' council would facilitate joint decision making in the future and would ensure that the body of employees can speak with one voice. Centers/Institutes: The structure and role of centers/institutes within the school is vague and not clearly defined. Neither is the process of their establishment or cancellation. This gives rise to the impression of ad hoc and opportunistic decision making regarding centers/institutes. As it is unclear, what individual centers/institutes contribute to the school, we should do less of them in the future. 
reduce thinking in silos and foster socializing between departments more: there is still too much thinking in sub-departments without looking at synergies and (quick-)wins/ when combining efforts (e.g. when looking at processes, use of resources, financial implications, etc.), e.g. why do we have MarCom, Marketing degree and Marketing exed in probably and roughly the same tasks/roles instead of combined Marketing with much more potential for thinking bigger, acting all encompassing/aligned, instead of just working off the same tasks in isolation and trice? There would be so much potential for mindset: still thinking a lot in established stereotypes (about each others roles and efforts, e.g. faculty prevails all...) and thinking back to the 'good' old times and 'how it used to be' (e.g. structure), need disruptive thinking about how we do what we do (not just teach it), and have the guts to drastically change approaches if the new idea appears to be promising &gt; get out of comfort zone. invest smartly: looking back at the trends and the word 'technology' as part of our name, it is at times rather difficult to see how we fulfill it / deserve it. We teach and preach about digitization but are rather slow in reflecting on it / adapting it to our own business. (e.g. maybe: the time and effort it takes to replace older beamers, when we should be thinking about much more advance technology for teaching already?). be more excellent: in our daily business, we normally do first and think through it later. Which is, on one hand, a great sign for our adaptability and flexibility. On the other hand, however, a lot of regular (if not even daily) routines could be more standardized (at least ‘guidable’) to take up less time of various individuals who work on those things at the same time. E.g. ranking results are now published, but no clear communication strategy from beginning to end exists and had been provided in advance to the process, although ranking have been part of ESMT for a number of years now. learn from experience: but do not get limited by it. continue and maybe expand to listen to our students and customers: if they are open enough to name their desires, wishes/needs, we should embrace them with much more focus as this is invaluable input we would otherwise hardly get (e.g. evaluations of programs should be much more concise impact measurement and be much more used for re-evaluating back our products/portfolio than we currently do with it/ same goes for expectations of participants and how we use it for the programs – if we get expectations in advance, why not use them for the design much more ‘personalized’). trust each other and collective competence: I think there are a lot of very capable people in our school and some of them have hidden talents no one would possibly see, less so use as a resource. We should continue to get to know each other better on informal/ social level to foster network of knowledge. Another, additional idea would be an informal ‘emc-ike’ group on an operational level, with no decision-making power whatsoever, but rather in the sense that there is a direct/ regular/ the same exchange about interschool activities happening on a lower level but with much more proximity to everyday pain-points and the possibility to see immediate synergies and possibilities of combination of efforts. have the right people/minds in the right places to move the right things. Just a general observation that it needs the right people to get things started/done. We should foster individual reflection of leadership styles (e.g. heads and team leads) and provide means for them to be able to lead the best possible way. Some heads might be stuck in their ways and will lead their teams respectively, why not allow them (and all of us) the chance to see how else things could be done. continue to take care of each other and think as one community: see Kurzarbeit and the implications as to who is actually affected directly and who is going with it for the greater good. live our values: great to see that we have them as a collective and think about what it means for the individual departments, but we should come back together after departments have defined it more individually to readjust back/all know from each other. At the moment, I would not remember what the values are, as they are not (maybe obviously enough or ‘aggressively’ enough) part of our day-to-day communication strategy. we lose a lot of working time/motivation/energy through out-dated processes, run into walls when attempting to improve them (e.g. hardship getting home office and due to current situation realizing that it works out just fine). We could use our time better/more efficient if we focused on the important things rather than be stuck in inapplicable or hindering process or people unwilling to accept/lead change for the sake of the greater improvement. change is only possible if the mind is in it. the less barriers we have, the less we live in the past, the more we can focus on what is to come and how we want to shape it, consequently implement it. communal thinking should not just be on paper.
Make far more efforts in the area of B2B and B2C sales, key account management, solution selling. Maybe create something like a field sales force. Cold calls? Offer online and onsite consultation hours. Setting up offices in certain cites. Focus more on the Berlin market than before. There are no travel expenses, no accommodation costs and any travel restrictions have no great impact. This unit must put the topic of marketing and sales much more strongly on the agenda than before. 
Idea 1: Establish the EdTech Team as a truly across-the-school resource for developing programs. Just as there are opportunities to reuse TMBA and PTMBA assets and chunks of learning journeys within ExEd programs, there is overlap in content and use of assets in the MBA, MIM, and EMBA (we've already reused videos from multiple TMBA videos in all three programs). To provide a more blended format for MBA, MIM, and EMBA would allow students to complete work asynchronously and open class time for more peer-to-peer learning. Additionally, we could design courses from a set of program-level learning objectives to insure we can easily spot gaps and redundancies in a program. With this, we should look into finding an asset management system for indexing and searching the learning objects we create. Also, having a cross-school team allows for a centralized home for teaching and learning as well as training and support for educational technology. For all of this to work well, we should decide on one LMS. Having two presents no value-add and presents considerable pain-points. Idea 2: We should also consider moving to projects and a digital portfolio for participants and students as a replacement for exams. For students, projects/a portfolio allows them to apply new technical skills to course concepts in a way which is much more reflective of a working environment. Who takes exams at a job? What are we teaching students when we teach to the exam? Additionally, perhaps students could showcase particular projects when applying for jobs as proof of their qualifications beyond a degree. For ExEd clients, perhaps they could come to a program with an actual work project which they can then apply the course concepts and skills towards. For the ExEd client stakeholders, this is immediately impactful as participants may be finishing the program with projects or ideas to help the business. Idea 3: We need to embrace a digital learning experience as being "different" to a face-to-face experience rather than being "worse." Continuing with this perception binds us to a mode of business which is incredibly uncertain for the next year and a half. Idea 4: Merge Media Service and the EdTech Media Team to be a cross-school unit. With a strong vision about what can be done with media, there are opportunities in every video production to make content which could be used in multiple contexts (courses, marketing, events). We should also consider making our own TedTalks-style presentations to showcase our instructors and our brand. Idea 5: I would like a value proposition in regards to developing content for to our clients in Asia. As I understand, clients from Asia look to Western institutions for their more "right brain" approach to education and learning. However, I've had experience where we are meant to create content with an idea of what an Asian client wants which runs counter to the best practices and learned experience of the EdTech team. Do we need to understand a new set of expectations and needs for Asian clients? Are we fully prepared to deliver something we believe in if we aren't totally sure what a great experience for those learners is? Or should we embrace our ESMT values around teaching and learning and only sell that to clients? Idea 6: In the move to online in response to corona, there's been a lot of enthusiasm towards developing a flashy webinar room or home recording set-ups without a clear understanding of the support, training, and practice involved in making those experiences truly impactful for students. Some instructors struggle with making solid webinars from their home now. Making a next-level recording environment will make things worse unless they are given the staff to support them and the time and incentive to practice practice practice. While we should look at all possible tech solutions, I think we should also talk about resources, workload, and how to insure accountability for instructors who fail to follow through on what's needed really make these experiences great. There's a lot more I could add to some of these points, much it formed from first-hand experience at a previous institution. I'm happy to further explain any of these ideas in detail!
stop believing that our campus is a distinctive asset. stop raising expectations by referring to all our founders as great supporters. start reviewing all internal activities and identify whether each of them has either an external or internal "client". stop doing those that do not. get funding to upgrade systems and processes. stop running the school on Excel sheets. put less emphasis discussing values, put more emphasis on creating value-add.
Organizational structure and internal processes: It is obvious that ESMT has developed from a small school to a medium-sized business rather quickly. Our processes developed historically and when you ask yourself why one person is in charge of something that should clearly not be in their area, you often hear "Das ist so historisch gewachsen" or "Das war schon immer so". While this surely made sense at the beginning, it is time to professionalize our processes, look at tasks more closely, evaluate which tasks should be in a different area, which can be optimized, and which are obsolete. I have really high hopes for the McKinsey colleagues' insights and recommendations for this. A few suggestions/thoughts from my side: Alumni relations can move to the degree area (more emphasis on the full student life cycle instead of regarding alumni solely as money givers). A proper President's Office with a few "Referenten" would allow other areas to have less tasks on their desks which are classic support tasks work for the president (that is a typical case of tasks that are not in certain people's areas, but for the lack of someone else we just do them...). Reconsider the organizational allocation of the Grants Department. With all the tasks and responsibilities in its area, it has interface functions with the CFO, legal, accounting/controlling, and the research area. Look at how other schools organize this department's work and then reconsider its organizational structure. This would improve its standing internally, and it would improve processes, e.g. making double workload (for example with Accounting) obsolete. Implement regular exchange meetings between all departments to catch up and learn what is new. Some areas may have news that are crucial for other areas, without them even knowing. E.g. where do we stand with the MBA application numbers, which new business stream are we working on in blended learning, which new research project has been initiating by a professor, what are current plans in the marketing area, which new IT tool is about to be implemented, etc. Regular "Head Meetings" (maybe once a month) could be an option and would help ESMT's problem of transparency a lot. It is quite sad that we often receive major news only after a press release was published. A final major issue that harms ESMT's competitiveness are our low wages which are (except for professor's salaries) significantly under market wages for administrative professionals at universities and research institutions in Germany (Tarif!). 
Providing transparency regarding salaries (I know that we are based in Germany, but we are an international school with international staff. Keeping employee’s salaries and generally, the whole salary scheme at ESMT in total secret still baffles me.). Offering internal and external training (As far as I see, the personal growth section got the lowest grades in the last two employee satisfaction surveys. I believe that ESMT employees have lots of potential and should be able to run one- or half-day workshops on different topics. This initiative has already started with the Lunch & Learn sessions, but should be further encouraged. Example: Negotiations workshop with Martin Schweinsberg or Decision Making session with Francis de Véricourt). Setting up a Betriebsrat (works council) (Because from the legal point of view, we should already have that.) Job-shadowing between different departments (Job-shadowing would be not only a great opportunity for exchange of experiences and good practices, but many times I have a feeling that my job is underappreciated as other colleagues have absolutely no idea what am I actually doing the whole day). Dog-friendly offices (Please do not laugh! :) This is a kind of grey area at ESMT, but I believe the ESMT needs more pets on campus. Their presence offers psychological support and forces employees to leave their work stations from time to time. A classic 2 in 1 solution). Last but not least, one of the most important points: Wing A. I am aware of the difficult financial situation of the school, however we cannot pause the Wing A project now. The earlier we can have additional Auditoriums and Seminar Rooms, the better. Scheduling is a nightmare from the logistical point of view for the period of September - May. If we need to stick to the social distancing guidelines for a while, I have no idea how September 2020 will look like on campus: Having on board the MBAs, 2 MIM classes, EMBAs and running ExEd events at the same time (and also, without the usual setup of the restaurant).
start an workers council. offer internal education on business ethics around virtual courses and being visible on screen, make people aware how they look and behave being on screen (presentation, background, etc). teach staff on how to use online tools. Increase marking team.
All ExEd programs should have at least one interactive element per day (not just a series of lectures / Q&A sessions) e.g. peer coaching, team challenges like the electric maze, role play scenarios with actors, Nora's digital "escape" game. Fewer case studies, more action! Our Moodle is outdated - and it's often the first impression we give to ExEd participants. We need a more intuitive and user-friendly alternative. More women's scholarships / ask female participants to nominate a female colleague for the next program cycle and both receive a financial reward. We can't continue to have only one or two women in the OE programs going forward. We should stop hiring executive coaches that live outside of Germany - their travel costs often exceed 500 Euro. Widen our network of Berlin-based executive coaches.
Think more about social responsibility and purpose. What is ESMT doing for the society as a whole? How can we be more sustainable? will help to attract (young) employees who search for purposeful employers. enable more participation why is no worker's council existing at ESMT? more flexibility. One thing I love about ESMT is the flexible working hours and trusting atmosphere. keep this up and further increase the possibility of home office, working remotely (e.g. also while traveling). more gender equality and more women in committees and top positions.
We need to ramp up our faculty, with a focus on business experience and teaching excellence. I think the heavy focus on research (over teaching/business experience) in our faculty is a big mistake. First, my impression is that only a fraction of their research is used in teaching, even though we claim the whole point of our research excellence is to teach based on cutting edge research. Second, our brand and a significant part of our revenue is made in ExEd, so the priority needs to be having faculty who can stand in front of executives. Yes, ExEd clients expect the teaching at a business school to be research-based, but they don't expect the speakers to have done all this research themselves. They expect speakers to have some serious business experience and gravitas. At a minimum to be an engaging speaker who can inspire and provoke. Right now, ExEd can only work with a small group of people from the faculty, forcing us to constantly work with outside partners. Collaboration between faculty and ExEd needs to change. First, we need to align faculty around the need to truly customize sessions in line with the customization of programs if we want to be serious about customization being our USP. Right now, I don't see faculty customizing content enough. There is little genuine interest in creating tailored sessions. Instead, we receive requests to compensate customization time with teaching points - at a point when the school is already spending big on over teaching. Second, we need to move towards a culture where ExEd is treated as an internal customer, not a petitioner who needs to court the faculty to get their buy-in and support. There is an invisible hierarchy between faculty and ExEd (or the rest of the school, for that matter) and a massive imbalance of power. ExEd should shift from program to key account focus, and manage by different metrics such as account-level impact tracking (as opposed to evaluations), account-level revenue retention and growth, customer engagement, etc. We should seriously cut back on rules and policies, and instead treat people as adults and trust them to do what's in the school's best interest. People come to work wanting to do a good job, the moment we start putting too many rules in place we kill this. Think expense report policy, home office policy. Bring the purpose and values to life. What does it mean for each department? How can we contribute to it. Let's make time to flesh this out.
start service and customer orientation approach across ALL departments for efficient running of daily admin. business. We need good "lubricants", so the "ESMT engine" can run smoothly. stop translate internal communication into German. All staff joining ESMT are aware we are an international institution with English as our business language. Translating into German seems like a waste of resources. Everyone knows how to use Google translator if needed. more living of sustainability topics! Actions speak louder than words: Avoid, e.g. production of waste when having internal celebrations. Do not offer trips with polluting boats on the river Spree for program participants, e. g. . No deals with tobacco companies. more fundraising a la Gentz/Faber. Are our "hidden champions" a group to address, perhaps? less globalization topics but give stronger focus to ESMT being located in the heart of Europe (make this a stronger selling point) - with its traditions, diversity, and values.
Start Bachelors’ program. Start blended programs in Exec Ed and tell stories around them.  Start to Define who we are and what we want to achieve. Start Educational consulting. Start Contract research (but be transparent in communication of this). Establish a digital studio, such as the IE WOW Room or the Skolkovo Glassroom. Stop	Trying to be IMD and INSEAD at the same time (see definition of who we are above). Stop	Use of file server, continue Intranet project to put everything in the cloud. Stop Silo thinking throughout organization. I am sorry that I do not have a great idea of how to do this. More Cross-selling. More Inclusive communication and marketing, also though Social Media with all ESMT employees and stakeholders . More Videos. More Sustainability in the curriculum.  More Virtual events when the events are content-driven. More Agile leadership in teams, giving individuals more responsibility for a given project / timeframe. Less Fewer events with low relevance. Less Paper brochures, paper in general.
START thinking of ourselves more as a place that creates/curates educational experiences for participants that they can not get anywhere else. Start seeing ourselves as their lifelong partner...I often feel like participants come here 1X and then we mostly only get in touch with them again if an exed program doesn't have enough participants...how can we tie them into ESMT as their lifelong partner for educational experiences and insights? Also so they feel more like "graduating into the ESMT community" directly after their exed program is finished? Start VERY SIMPLE: have "hosts" welcome the participants each day in the foyer...now people enter this intimidating building and they have to ask SECURITY how to get to their seminar room. I think our security is GREAT but their job is not to make participants feel special and welcome, their job is to keep the building safe. Instead I think we should have 1 or 2 hosts downstairs (could be student assistants) who literally just welcome participants, if need be bring them to their seminar room and maybe already answer some questions. It would cost something like €25-€30 / hour and you might only need them for 1-2 hours...people remember beginnings and endings and so making the beginning seamless from the start seems super important to me and would make this a great and cheap investment. You might even have someone standing actually outside the building because it's not clear to the first time visitor where and how to enter. STOP taking them to the canteen each meal. I think the canteen is actually embarrassing for exed participants. the main difference between the canteen as an exed participant and a regular participant is. no need to take the plastic Tablet as exed participant. the starter you feel forced to eat is 1 of the ingredients from the salad bar. What's worse, you often get the starter that was part of yesterday's salad bar. INSTEAD we could take them at least 1x to the Hotel D'Europe for example, their lunch menu is literally just a few € more than the canteen option, and that would actually be an experience participants will remember and not forget. Maybe always do this on the last day of the program and then end with highlights before the day/program ends. MORE leveraging our unique position in Berlin. What kinds of educational experiences can we create/curate that EBS,WHU, INSEAD can't offer because of their location? what can we learn from an exed powerhouse such as IMD? from what I can tell they put a very high emphasis on the complete participant experience. LESS Selling more programs as part of the program. I always thought it was very awkward when "someone from business development will come and talk to you"on the last day. we might want to instead introduce ourselves differently, NOT as "coming from business development" (which is like speaking from our perspective and which communicates that we see participants as business that we want to develop) and instead somehow frame this as advice, consulting, helping them develop a learning plan...something like that. less emphasis on selling, more emphasis on consulting and advice. at times this might then even mean suggesting a book or something that is not directly purchasable from ESMT but will increase trust tremendously. have our "business development people/consultants" join from day 1, mingle at the coffee breaks, or over lunches. to get to know participants so that over time we can find out what participants want and then make the appropriate recommendations. I always felt that having our business development people join for lunch on the last day felt a bit like "cold calling" someone over lunch.
We have to become thought leaders to attract students and companies to consume our programs. This requires not only ground-breaking research but also a very systematic and efficient way to promote, diffuse, and translate research into learning tools and modules. While teaching basic topics is required and we need to do it well, the need for differentiation requires us to develop a continuous stream of insights that are not only published into top journals but also communicated widely to the business and popular press. From every relevant top research paper, we should derive 10 business and popular press publications and convert the insight contained in the paper into teaching opportunities. We are doing this to some extent, but we need to do a lot more of it. Clearly, this effort needs to be consistent with identity positioning and brand image. Also, it is not clear that researchers are the best people to disseminate their own research.
Start more for-credit stackable qualifications developed in different delivery modes. Start a new approach to research which is driven by SDGs rather than the current list of A+ journals. Start more partnership programs with consulting/coaching companies (e.g. Enterprise Ireland model). Start hiring more teaching faculty. Stop full-time MBA, or pare it down to what is the very minimum required for ranking and compete with a niche program with a low price (to improve selectivity, reduce marketing costs for MBA). Stop academic research which does not have a specific business or societal rationale.
MORE being more flexible with the home office policy (has already been mentioned by Georg Garlichs, but still), e.g. with more online courses it could work to combine work at the office and at home (for example 5 hours at the office and 3 hours at home). This could be particularly interesting for mothers, some of who are currently forced to work part-time (due to whatever reason), but this way they could - where possible - actually have a full-time job and be less susceptible to old-age poverty. Or offering "job sharing" (e.g. two people share one full-time job, e.g. mothers).  This way ESMT can be an example of "new work" and social responsibility (or rather, even more than it is already). stop flying all across the globe for one-/two-day events. It is not sustainable and as we are witnessing right now, it can be done online.
What to change: There are a lot of structures that have grown over the years that simply make no sense in the broader organizational chart. New colleagues regularly struggle to find the correct person to talk to in certain matters because the person they think is responsible for something is actually to taking care of this. Examples include but are not limited to why the Frauke taking care of the sales force backend configuration? Why is this not with IT? why is legal organizing committee meetings and taking the minutes? There should be president's office which is taking this on (I do NOT mean for this to be with Frauke or Claudia; there should be a separate entity that is taking of matters like this).  why is a faculty assistance coodinating the Phd program? On paper she is only an FA is is paid accordingly. This is unfair and uneccessary. why is development / fundraising coordinating students activities like Master Classes. Where is the fundraising in this? It appears that this has changed a bit since Corona and more is done by student services, but Jack is only one person and often overwhelmed with student requests regarding visa issues and other organizational tasks. Some offices are severely understaffed (see student services). During high-demand times (i.e. start of new degree programs) offices like student services are operating with over 100% for several weeks if not months depending on the severity of cases. This leads to significant stress and dissatisfaction on the employee side and in disappointed students on the other. Financial aspect: There has been significant talk about ESMT's payscheme in the past and I don't believe I have to go into a lot of detail here. However, there are two aspects that I want to mention. Since ESMT is paying its admin stuff way below what is common in other business schools, we open ourselves up for a severe brain drain. I believe it is not yet fully understood by management that you do not only need a great faculty that drives our reputation forward but also a great admin staff. I have seen a significant turn-over in program managers in both the degree and ExEd teams. Capable, effective employees who know ESMT's structure and people leave because their salary encreases significantly somewhere else. Yes, ESMT has a great community and people like it but - and I cannot stress this enough - please (!) do not believe that this community will keep people from leaving. I've seen this in my own team. For ESMT the result can be devastating as knowledge of organizational proceedings and personal connections are lost. The new team member has to pick up the pieces and sometimes start from scratch and rebuild. This takes away a lot of momentum and decreases the effectiveness of a department. A significant lower salary also means that we cannot recruit capable people that can drive forward innovation, since those people go where they are paid according to the value they bring to the institution. In the end this means that ESMT goes to great lengths of training people only to have those people leave and take their training and knowledge with them. Please use the same criteria for when it comes to hiring faculty on staff! Make use of ESMT's financial knowledge. It's a great thing that we offer open enrollment courses to our employees, but I believe that this is not having the intended effect. Program managers or FAs who are at the beginning of their careers simply do not care about a course offering leadership advice or finance for non-finance executives. They have no use for this. Please don't get me wrong, this is a great thing to have and more senior level employees and those with high career ambitions will and are making use of this (however, please see my point on paying people enough - this is also a contributing factor! Train people and then they take that training somewhere else). What every employee needs is to know on how to use the money that they have effectively. Jörg himself mentioned in one of his open lectures. The problem: A lot of people have no idea how to start with stocks, bonds and fonds. They don't want to risk what little they have. My idea: Offer employees the option to get an understanding of how the stock market works and how to invest their money. I have talked to colleagues from different departments and all are trying to get a grip on how to start. Every single one of these people have read things on the internet and are trying to learn themselves but in the end they are too hesitant because they have not had professional coaching. ESMT has the investment club that teaches students on how to invest. Why not use these resources on employees? I'm not talking about telling people exactly in what to invest but for what factors to look for when choosing an ETF (for example). Offer workshops on a regular basis and have people ask questions on topics they are specifically interested in. We have the capabilities, please let us use them and live what we preach to externals! 
More focus on sustainability.
I  think we should expand our range of courses - new subjects and new formats (for example more online courses and more short courses) to attract a wider audience. We should also involve some SMEs or industry experts in the creation and delivery of our courses to attract a bigger audience. We should also consider investing in life-long learning by offering additional training such as short courses, resources or even a 'membership' to those who have studied with ESMT or would like to continue their studies with us. This could generate some revenue, maybe new leads and also increase our visibility. More joint programs, summer schools, internships etc. with other business schools. Russia and China could be interesting market in this regard. When we do so, we can reach out to a larger number of international students and increase our international presence. Include more of the Technology: more practical modules on how to use technology and digital innovation in daily business life. Offer new specializations like MBA in IT/ Engineering Management/ Applied Science. SMM: a very concrete example: to configure Google Adwords. We are TOP 9 globally and Top 1 in Germany. When I google "Business school" or "MBA",  ESMT is not the first result by far.
start investing on the campus (we need more space) AND in the employee facilities - we need a more creative work space! less unnecessary paper work - especially in the accounting department - please overthink the processes, make it easier and faster.
We should open a (small) campus overseas. It could be London. (Warwick for example). I believe it would help tremendously in terms student recruitment, student internship and job search, as well as our ExecEd. It would also help the school performance in international rankings.
start connecting to tech scene and start-ups more. Students want it, it shines back on ESMT when we are connected early to future big players and also broadens the focus of ESMT. stop being that heavily focussed on the "big players" only; especially when it comes to our events like the Annual Forum. It would be great to have fresh and diverse faces there instead of the same old white CEOs only (exaggerated a bit..). A mix could also be refreshing for them and attract a new audience. more female faculty: good for rankings, marketing and enriching in general. more sustainability topics in the curricula.
The challenge remains at being able to do all the above with limited capacity and maintaining scholarly research productivity and impact. We need to increase capacity, but we are always constrained by budgets, which are tied back into the revenues generated from exec ed and programs. We end up in a chicken and egg result. I assume that growth will be gradual (as opposed to rapid increases fueled by external money from founders and alike) which limits what can be changed in the near future. Within the existing capacity and growth rates, we need to improve faculty efficiency and alignment in general. This calls for revising incentive structures, pointing systems, organizational structures etc. We can generate a laundry list of other things to change, ranging  from motivating and rewarding research, its transfer to teaching domains, overall governance structure to growing online content creation capacity, having real learning designers, different teaching support and delivery pools, shifting of recruitment and marketing budgets from physical to online, etc. In the absence of data and critical analysis, I find it difficult to do this credibly and in an non speculative manner. I hope the McKinsey project will give some guidance in this regard.
start to dissolve organizational structure and blend-in into a client/market-focused (in some cases clients=students) project structure. start acting like an innovation-led dynamic research-based, academically based life-long learning provider: business school in partnership with businesses. stop thinking & acting like universities 20 years ago, accepting poor results or loosing focus to motivate people, loose contact to pax & clients. More exed teaching content: digital strategy, methodology, innovation, business, AI & robotics; global business, sustainability; interrelated academic content among disciplines & academic chairs; PD development - learning, academic careers to faculty members, career perspectives for PMs, psychological safety, cooperation & networks (strategic & content creating), sponsors & ambassadors, alumni cooperation, fun at work, during work, spontaneously. Less overprotection (of PM), procedural work, leisure events (scheduled fun).
Through more interdisciplinary research and teaching with strong emphasis on relevance and positive impact. For this we need to create more synergies between different departments and internal stakeholders.
MORE Quick wins Communication with participants via Salesforce (in progress). More Digitalization of the admission process for seminars and payable events. More Creating a kind of transparency for all departments in order to get quicker results / research on our customers. More digitalize of aggregation sheet, sales, fundraising, donations, grants etc. More Student and participants life cycles, sales processes. Less Excel Sheets.
START Build a digital room. As an example, here is a glass room in SKOLKOVO. It is in Russian, but it gives a great overview of what I have in mind. This should be our step number one. I am convinced that if we had such a room, it would be more attractive for both students AND faculty. STOP Do not save on faculty. And stop thinking of useless cooperations.MORE Hire more faculty. Yes, yes, yes, it is budget and efforts but we need faculty urgently, otherwise we could forget about all other efforts. LESS Say "yes" to events that are not relevant or revenue generating. 
Allowing the employees to have a more flexible home office policy. More transparency regarding Kurzarbeit is needed. Lot of employees have been working overtime despite the changes in their working hours and the clarity on how and when the changes will be lifted would be appreciated. Ensuring that overtime work is properly compensated. More clarity on how the fixed salary system compares to the bonus system - releasing average figures or organizing a seminar on this particular issue would be helpful. There are many employees to who the difference between these two systems is not clear. More Investing in trainings on diversity and interpersonal skills/communication. Tech skills for employees - regular in-depth trainings for different tools, software and apps. Tech training for professors - providing professors with tech training would make the job of student-facing professionals easier as very often it is these employees who end up having to train professors, set up tech for them, administer delivery, etc. More Investing in the staff professional growth - sponsoring a professional certificate course/language course/study experience. Allowing the staff to participate in the exed programs. Professional network building - encouraging employees to build long-lasting professional relationships with colleagues from other institutions. This could be done by sponsoring the participation of ESMT employees in networking events/conferences. Contacts and relationships gained through such activities would allow ESMT employees to provide better service to their clients and customers by collaborating with their colleagues from other institutions.
Start A points-based system (much like teaching points), where those ultimately responsible for revenue (e.g., program directors and faculty) purchase staff functions with points, from their own budgets and/or research envelopes. If introduce a market logic, we can greatly improve the experience and compensation of our staff, while minimizing inefficiencies. Start To respond to changed norms after the pandemic, let’s make it possible for members of the ESMT community to minimize manual contact with surfaces throughout the building. Using one’s feet to automatically open doors, flush toilets, and so forth – this is a practical response to concerns raised by the crisis.
Stop overloading Faculty. Start hiring more diverse faculty. Start creating more opportunities for staff upward mobility and professional development. More focus on Faculty professional development around online teaching and learning. Stop using outdated terminology such as knowledge transfer. More Edtech team staff that can support the school in meeting the growing demands of online programs. More staff development around technological tools that make work more efficient and a well staffed IT department that can offer these suggestions and trainings. Start paying staff a livable wage for Berlin now not ten years ago and review this yearly. More community approaches to change and less top to bottom. More surveys such as this and strategy projects such as this. More hiring of program directors in ExEd who are onboard and value online or blended programs. More pro bono programs such as the AIMS program. Start operating as a single school with less boundaries between ExEd and Degrees with Marketing and Branding.
Degree students highly value the on-campus ESMT experience. Should there be an increased number of students, especially in the MIM program, the campus would need to expand. It would be beneficial to have several more auditoriums, study room spaces, etc. at our disposal for the programs that are currently, and hopefully further on, running. This would enable a more optimal on-campus experience. Offer preparatory courses over the summer months for the degree programs (mainly targeting MIMs), be it digitally, or on-campus, for incoming students, or even externals. Introduction to quant-based courses would be helpful, such as intro to R, data science, etc. as a lot of students lack these useful skills.  
Start a person/team focusing on organization development to drive this in my view. More I believe to drive digitalization at ESMT, it is necessary that we need to think about how we can have a team focusing on that. I think it great what Frauke has been doing for the last years with Salesforce but we should put more (wo)man power in this area. Why not have a project team (for let’s stay 2 years or something) to establish the right work streams and processes to work with salesforce. Salesforce is currently used by exed, degree programs, marcom and development. But I believe that there is a lack of data maintenance work and process work to be done. Also taking a look at the administration departments, we could consider a unified platform (like SAP) for HR, accounting, controlling, facility management, IT etc. This would help a lot in terms of work streams and controlling data. Less Printing things! Seriously. Why are we still printing so much? I also like to sometimes print out a few pages to read but why don’t we really think about what we need to print and what we do not need to print? Establishment of a green policy for ESMT that includes our commitment to a greener future. I see that for example in accounting, even though the incoming invoice process is paperless, there are still pages of paper to be printed for credit card invoices or travel reimbursements. Why is this necessary? 
Start incentives to continue to bring the wage/salary system to perfection by more transparent communication, by developing an incentive system to encourage new thoughts and great efforts, by offering more "scholarship" for employees.Stop Using environmental unfriendly materials in program or school facility. More Sustainable development needs to be seriously considered, it is not only from the interests of the students, but also important to the reputation.
We should start finding pioneers, creative minds, talents thinking out-of-the box to help us make the INNOVATION pillar more visible.  How about being innovative in ExecEd and think of connecting participants from an open program about innovation with participants from a leadership program and let them work on a (small) practice project.
Lets START to deliver course content online. STOP traditional lectures ("Frontalunterricht"). Let's use our campus MORE for discussions, exchange of ideas and experiences and networking in smaller groups. LESS for big events where people just sit and listen, but not communicate.
Start to be serious about sustainability in all decisions made (e.g. green catering for internal celebrations, no stinky motor grass cutting on campus but rechargeable battery lawnmowers, no deals with tobacco companies). More fundraising  a la Gentz/Faber. Perhaps connect with family-owned hidden champions companies. Stop Translating internal communications into German in times of google translator . Seems a big waste of resources in our great Marcom team. More service and customer orientation across all admin departments. They are the lubricants needed for ESMT engine to run smoothly and efficiently. Start founding an innovation hub to bring innovation pillar to (more) life.
ESMT is in plain change modus due to exogenous factors - so it is rather a question of survival to change to more blended formats and adapt to new ways of teaching. The marketing budget should be increased, to create a better brand recognition.
As mentioned we need very intensitve cooperation and exchange between faculty - exed and degree. Not against each other. Exed and degree should offer joint programs. More Booster, exed MBA and so on. Faculty should teach more exed. Not just scientifically relevant but also practice relevance research. When hiring faculty, we should pay attention to whether they can teach degree and exed. The point system should motivate faculty to engage in exed and degree just as in research. Faculty can use intensive contact with managers for research and questionaires. Administration of ESMT, controlling, accounting and IT, should feel as part of the service institution ESMT, serving the same customer as exed and degree. This is missing.
Increase the share of academics from other disciplines. May it be computer scientists, engineers, biologists etc. (start)
This will help research and the organizational culture in general. Focused networking events for entrepreneurship on a more regular basis. Such events could also aim to bring start-ups and investors or business angels together (more). ESMT needs to make itself well-known as a source of great entrepreneurs and to do that it should make use of its location (Berlin). Revisit meeting culture (less). I heard people complaining about meetings being too long and too many people sitting in one room without adding value. Introduce / recommend more slack or introduce Microsoft Teams or any other tool and make it a company standard (or make it a recommendation for senior managers) when working at ESMT to improve communication processes. Today there are too many options and people need to dig into different tools before choosing the best option. No tool should become mandatory but guidelines can help people to navigate through the jungle of digital tools. Not tech-savvy workers might find it tedious and would greatly benefit from revised guidelines.
We need more faculty who can teach practice-relevant content. Example: Even though digitalization and digital transformation have been hot topics for many years, we are still not able to run an exed program fully with own resources. We should be able to cover at least the core topics with our own faculty. We need more faculty who excel at teaching and who is willing to teach. Currently, only few faculty members are able to meet the high demands of exed. We have to recruit the right faculty who has the skills and interest in working with executives. And we also have to set up some kind of process to help them develop teaching excellence. We need more diverse faculty. In terms of nationality, we are doing fine. But in terms of gender, it is embarrassing what we have.  When clients ask us for female speakers, we have only very limited choice. This also hurts us in the rankings. We claim to be a research-based business school. And we invest a lot of money into faculty. But I miss the research that makes impact on business. Our professors might be well known among their academic peers. But only few of them do research that is relevant for our clients and participants. (Just give a group of managers a pile of research papers and see how they react.) Even fewer ESMT professors are known by the business world. We need a broader discussion about the research at our school, what the purpose of the research should be and how we can enhance our effectiveness here. Lecturer profile within faculty: Make the profile of “lecturer” more attractive (e.g., realistic expectations in terms of teaching points, etc.) and build up cool people (above all female) who can run great sessions. There are people within or outside of ESMT who are interested in teaching. While their material is based on research, they are not always interested in doing research themselves. These people should be diverse (gender, nationality, …) and PART of the faculty. This way, we could close the teaching gap we have and enhance the diversity of our faculty. The clients will like it and it will also boost us in the rankings.  Strategic/budget planning: We have to stop the way we did planning in the past (e.g., 2018). The business lines made a plan, then Jörg and Georg together with McKinsey simply increased the numbers. The goals became completely unrealistic – yet the school was run as if we would reach these targets. This time, we should be realistic about what we can achieve and what we can finance. We should explain our situation in all honesty to the Supervisory Board. We have great people at ESMT who are willing to take on stretching goals – but we should stop giving businesses unreachable goals. And we should make sure that there is a strategic logic behind the numbers. We should be able to understand and explain why we believe that we can make this or that number. Make clear strategic choices and communicate: We are a small business school with only limited resources/funds. We just cannot afford doing everything at the same time. We teach that strategy is about making choices – also at ESMT, we should take the necessary decisions about how we want to move further, what we do and what we DON’T do. Can we really become a research-based b-school like INSEAD with 40 or more professors? How can we finance this? What are some other options we have? Let’s use this project to evaluate these options without biases or politics. And when the choices are made, please explain the why, the rationale. Be open about whether we go left or right. Marketing: Our outside appearance and branding must become better. For instance, the ESMT image film is terrible. The website doesn’t create a “wow.” We have limited budgets, that I understand. But even then, there must be ways to be more creative, more attractive, more modern in the way how we appear.
We absolutely have to be stronger in marketing - let people get to know our brand, be more precise about who we are, and decide whether we are the school founded by business or we are No.1 in Germany. Stick to one message, repeat it thousand times over all channels, and make consistent campaigns across degree, exed. Our marketing is more press than marketing. The school marketing and degree and exed look apparently disconnected, for people from outside this organization. Why not create more channels? Our website is nice, but so user Unfriendly, it is amazing! Try search and find anything meaningful! Even employees get frustrated looking for webpages, how can we expect the externals to understand the strange three sub website logic? Our content generated by faculty is way too far away from what (potential) students and (potential) clients are concerned with. The academia finding the papers or topics interesting would  not be searching on our website anyway, so, please create more content that is 'practical', 'up-to-date' and 'relevant'. And again, citing or writing can be done, without faculties producing papers first. This could be done by marketing alone. Can we have more 'institutionalized' collaboration at working level between degree, faculty and exed and also supporting functions? EMC is the only 'breaking the silo' regularly example, beyond this, we need people at working level exchange and work together on new development. Professors can start saying hi to people. This is necessary because or else people stop working with the highest paid group of ESMT and we dont get value then out of these people. 
We should foster collaboration among the departments to create synergy. All units should work together towards the same strategic goal because there is a common interest and shared motivation. Talking about motivation, we perhaps need to find a better way keeping the ones with sparkles and fire. We need to make sure that there is a different voice in the organization. Those voices should be value and those people should be encouraged to speak up. We need to help the employees in their career growth and provide support, space and opportunities for such growth. HR and IT will need to play a more significant and proactive role in the organizational re-structuring and the digitalization process.
At the moment, the school does not engage in centralized planning of the utilization of one of the key resources - faculty teaching. The assignment of faculty to teaching assignments takes place on an ad hoc basis and is not done on mid-term perspective. Individual programs approach faculty on an ongoing basis and request teaching. There lacks a centralized overview who is teaching how much in what programs that looks beyond a 12 months window. It is impossible for faculty to an answer to simple questions like: In what courses do you expect me to teach next year... The process might be optimized by introduced a centralization of teaching planning.
in general, the school should be much more agile. ESMT is still a start-up but organized around rigid processes that does not allow the school to move fast. Also, there may be ways to innovate in teaching, especially using a blended approach. 
Integration of new and additionally open seminar offerings in the middle price segment (e.g. haufe), for example in for of a ESMT academy. Integration of open webinars. Creation of knowledge packages for certain topics that can be purchased online. Creation of a new pricing and rebate structure. More integration of our unique core competencies. Decrease seminar offerings to specialize on core topics. Increase offering of seminars for junior managers to appeal to larger masses. Establish a podcast to attract customers. Establish online exchange as a topic forum. Expand business breakfast. Align e-mails better with target groups to provide individual character. Avoid fluctuations of employees at all levels. Retain human resources and expand them. More automatization of processes with new software. Optimize process long term.
